\subsection*{To test the correctness of range probing when developing the code\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Create a test idx file where entries are in ascending order
\item Range probe will be run on each entry in the idx file and check against the expected result in the test idx file as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item on a greater-\/than-\/and-\/equal-\/to range probe, a vector of result on current entry from test idx file must then match all (key,rid) pairs after the current entry in test idx file
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item To run\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ex\+: ./test\+\_\+2048 range\+\_\+test.\+idx -\/range\+\_\+probe\+\_\+key\+\_\+gt\+\_\+test /dev/shm/btree\+\_\+test/2048\+\_\+btree\+\_\+index /dev/shm/genome/v0/data.bin
\item range\+\_\+test.\+idx is the testing idx file that contains all the entries I would like to test the range probe against.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Testing on more than 1000 entries can be very slow because confirming all results from all probes is O(n$^\wedge$3)
